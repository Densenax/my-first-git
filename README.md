# my-first-git

This project is a result of a hands-on activity for Git Basics. 
In this activity, I was able to execute the following: 

* Create a locally initialized Git Repository
* Add files to staging area and commit code changes
* Create a remote repository on GitHub
* Pushing the code changes to the remote repository
* Cloning a project from a remote repository
